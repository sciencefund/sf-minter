# Security Concerns, A Plan.


This documents our emergency response in case of being hacked.  Due to the nature of blockchain, we should think about designing our token system in a way that is able to withstand the test of time. 


```
How long do we want this project to last? It could be eternity if we design it well from the start.
```

What is our intention for the first round of deployment?


## During Development

Well designed tokens is important. Strike a balance between simplicity as well as maintaining upgradeable flexibility is an art. We need to question really hard about what we really want for this version.

**Access Control**




**Upgradeability**

Upgradeability 


**Multisig integration**



## Pre-Deployment


**Security Audit**

A proper security audit is important. We should raise money to get a security audit. 

**More eyes**
ask friends to look through the contract


**More tools**
use security tools

## Post-Deployment Monitoring

We need to set up off-chain monitoring of events to keep track of things. 

## Emergency Response

**Pause**


**Upgrade**

If the person who can pause has his keys compromised, what should we do?
